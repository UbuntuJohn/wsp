				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<p>
				Exotic Animal Experience is a small mom and pop type business that delivers an experience of a lifetime! 
				They have several lemurs, Kangaroo Joeys and a Muntjac Deer to experience up in person at this unique 
				petting zoo. They only have one problem, and it is the way they are using their website to bring in new 
				customers. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Currently, the site requires all potential visitors to call the owner about prices and 
				available dates. This could be a hassle for their visitors who may have busy lives and would 
				overall prefer to make reservations online. It also requires users to visit their facebook page to 
				get ticket prices, which is a bit of a problem for older people without facebook profiles 
				(required to sign in).
				</p>
				<p>
				In order to fix the two following issues above, the redesign would have to include all ticket 
				prices and an easy to use reservation system that should be both easy for the client to access and 
				customer to use. Of course, this would be slightly changing the way Exotic Animal Experience does 
				its work, so business acceptance of this idea is a must.
