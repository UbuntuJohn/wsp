			<img class="page_img" src="../keenan_john-prototype/images/kids_feeding.jpg" />
			<p>
			Come enjoy the company of lemurs, kangaroos, deer, a kinkajou and more!  This is an individually-scheduled, personal,
hands-on encounter with animals you normally only get to view through bars and cages.  The animals are tame and love human interaction.
			</p>
			<p>
			We also host birthday parties, events, field trips and, on occasion, do off-property appearances, depending on who is available to travel.   
Learn about our endangered species and what we can do to help with conservation!

Check out our latest youtube videos below, as seen on
 MSN, Animal Planet, Inside Edition, Good Morning America, Right This Minute and Red Eye!
			</p>
			<p>
			Our animals are available for tours, parties, field trips and week-long educational camps.
We also do appearances at parties and schools and any event, or schedule a visit to come join us here at the farm--call and schedule
your personal, hands-on, interactive "experience" with the animals today!
